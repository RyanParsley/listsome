In an effort to avoid distraction and get right to writing, I chose to start this blog on Jekyll. It's a simple enough tool that lets me draft posts in markdown. I'm dragging this post in my phone as I pace the floor trying to get my youngest to take a nap. 

The major potential downside with choosing Jekyll is, I'm not familiar with it. It's made with familiar stuff, but I know very little about it. I don't know if it's the perfect tool, but that fits the tone of this blog and may give me more content to write about.

## Why Jekyll?

As I mentioned before, Jekyll sites are built from a collection of plain text markdown files. This means I can write posts in any text editor of my choosing. I don't need a special app to get work done (although, I am enjoying Mr. Hyde). I don't need to set up a CMS or blog platform on a server. All the software needed to make it work runs in my phone.

In general, I'm a big fan of static site generators. I use assemble.io at work on many projects and I've enjoyed working with middleman in the past. In that sense, Jekyll is familiar. A big factor in choosing it over a similar tool that I know better is it's seamless integration with github pages. This had me looking at "Hello World" in less than an hour counting all the time I wasted browsing themes.
