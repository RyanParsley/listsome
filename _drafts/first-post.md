In an effort to avoid distraction and get right to writing, I chose to start this blog on Jekyll. It's a simple enough tool that lets me draft posts in markdown. I'm dragging this post in my phone as I pace the floor trying to get my youngest to take a nap. 

The major potential downside with choosing Jekyll is, I'm not familiar with it. It's made with familiar stuff, but I know very little about it. I don't know if it's the perfect tool, but that fits the tone of this blog and may give me more content to write about.

## Why Jekyll?
Markdown
Ruby
Github
Static

## How?

Github Pages today. Tomorrow, who knows?
